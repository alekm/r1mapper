## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Ruckus One account with **Administrator API access** (required for LLDP neighbor discovery)
- Application token (Client ID, Client Secret, Tenant ID)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alekm/r1mapper.git
cd r1mapper
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Configuration

On first launch, you'll be prompted to configure your Ruckus One API credentials:

1. **Region**: Choose your Ruckus One region (North America, Europe, or Asia)
2. **Tenant ID**: Your Ruckus One tenant identifier
3. **Client ID**: Application token client ID
4. **Client Secret**: Application token client secret

#### How to get your credentials:

1. Log into your Ruckus One account
2. Navigate to **Administration ‚Üí Account Management ‚Üí Settings**
3. Create an **Application Token** with Administrator scope
4. Copy the Client ID, Client Secret, and Tenant ID
5. Enter these values in the configuration modal

## Usage

### Map View (`/map`)
- **Venue Overview**: See all venues plotted on a geographical map
- **Venue Selection**: Use the sidebar to select venues when markers are clustered
- **Navigation**: Click "View Topology" to switch to the topology view for that venue

### Topology View (`/topology`)
- **Venue Selection**: Choose a venue to view its network topology
- **Layout Options**: Switch between different layout algorithms
- **Device Interaction**: 
  - Click devices to view details
  - Drag devices to custom positions
  - View LLDP connections with port information
- **RF Neighbors**: For Access Points, trigger RF scans and view wireless neighbors
- **View Management**: Save, load, and delete custom topology views per venue

### Device Management
- **Device Details**: Comprehensive information panel with status, configuration, and location
- **RF Neighbor Discovery**: Trigger and query RF neighbors for Access Points
- **LLDP Discovery**: Automatic neighbor discovery for switches and APs
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time device status with color-coded indicators

### View Management
- **Save Views**: Save custom device positions and layout types per venue
- **Load Views**: Quickly switch between saved topology arrangements
- **Reset Views**: Clear custom positioning and recalculate layouts
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevent accidental loss of custom positioning work

## API Integration

The application integrates with the following Ruckus One API endpoints:

### Authentication
- OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow
- JWT token management with automatic refresh

### Core Endpoints
- `/venues` - Get venue information
- `/venues/{venueId}/aps` - Get access points for a venue
- `/switches` - Get switch devices
- `/switches/{switchId}/ports` - Get switch port information

### Neighbor Discovery
- `PATCH /venues/{venueId}/aps/{serialNumber}/neighbors` - Trigger RF neighbor collection
- `POST /venues/{venueId}/aps/{serialNumber}/neighbors/query` - Query RF neighbors
- LLDP neighbor discovery via switch port queries

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation between views
- **Mapping**: Leaflet, React-Leaflet for geographical visualization
- **Visualization**: Custom SVG-based topology rendering
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **State Management**: React hooks and localStorage for persistence

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build optimized production bundle
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality

### Design System

The application uses a centralized CSS architecture with Tailwind CSS:

- **Color Scheme**: Orange gradient theme inspired by r1helper
- **Typography**: Desktop-optimized fonts and sizing
- **Components**: Reusable CSS classes for buttons, cards, forms, and layouts
- **Responsive**: Desktop-first design (explicitly not mobile-optimized)

## Demo Mode

The application includes a demo mode with sample data for testing and demonstration purposes. Enable demo mode from the configuration modal to explore features without API credentials.
